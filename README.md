SuperJarioES+, a modification of the SuperJarioES emulator created by Jason for Java

Original can be found at: https://code.google.com/p/jario/

SuperJarioES+ adds the following new features:

- Fast Forward (with options to disable Audio/Video for about 1000fps for use in AI) 

- Save State / Load State

- Record state / Playback State 

- Memory Tools (read/write any memory fairly easily)

- Debugging Memory Tools (watch memory values)

- AI System to manage controller input, read memory, control game speed (to perform generations faster) 

- Super Metroid AI (incomplete) 

 - --World is rebuilt using tiles (was hoping to use this for Machine Learning AI to know about walls/pathing)
 - --Game specific memory manipulation functions (health, missles, positions, velocity, etc)
