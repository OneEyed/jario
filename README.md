SuperJarioES+, a modification of the SuperJarioES emulator created by Jason for Java

Original can be found at: https://code.google.com/p/jario/

SuperJarioES+ adds the following new features:

- Fast Forward / Slow-mo

- Save State / Load State

- Record state / Playback State 

- Memory Tools (read/write any memory fairly easily)

- Debugging Memory Tools (watch memory values)

- Super Metroid AI (incomplete) 

 - --World is rebuilt using tiles (was hoping to use this for Machine Learning AI to know where walls are located)
 - --Game specific memory manipulation functions (health, missles, positions, velocity, etc)
